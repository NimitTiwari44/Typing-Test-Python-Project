# Typing-Test-Python-Project
<br>
This project is a typing speed and accuracy test implemented in Python. It allows users to measure their typing speed (words per minute) and accuracy by comparing their input against a randomly chosen test paragraph
<br>
Key Features
<br>
Typing Speed Measurement: Calculates typing speed in words per minute (WPM).
<br>
Error Detection: Counts the number of errors in the user's input compared to the provided text.
<br>
Real-time Measurement: Uses the time library to measure the duration taken by the user to type the input.
<br>
Randomized Test Paragraphs: Uses the random library to select a random test paragraph from a predefined list.
